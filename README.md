## getting starded 

This application allow to calculate several statistic distribution, they inverses, and also parameters inference, such as mean, variance, and standard deviation.

The application it's also a Java-Android Open Source application, so anyone can help to improve the application and/or improve it.
Each `Calculator` allow to set any parameter before to call the calculate() method, and try to fill the rest of the parameters 
with the current ones. this allow to an easy and quick implentation of each view.

## Distribution

### Binomial Distribution

Set 

n (poblation size) , r (sample size) and p probability to get -> F, P, G, mean, variance, etc

n (poblation size) , r (sample size) and F -> r

n, p, F -> r

### Normal Distribution

(leave mean 0 and standard deviation 1 to use standard)

F -> x, F
G -> x, F
x -> F, G

### Poisson Distribution
(leave t (time frame) = 1 unless there is a different time frame in the frecuence) 

lambda (frecuence), t (time), r -> F, P, G, etc
lambda, t, F -> r, etc
lambda, t, G -> r, etc

### T-Student distribution

v (nu) , x -> F, G, etc
v, F -> x, etc

### F-- Fisher Snedecor distribution
